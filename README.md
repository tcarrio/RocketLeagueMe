#RocketLeagueMe

The hopes of this app is to create an app for my friends and I that will allow us to effectively notify each other that we are available and playing Rocket League. 

This will use a combination of the Steam API to check player status as well as voluntary push-notifications originating from the app to let others know when they get on to play.
